<!--
The first thing any document using more-routing must do is configure the driver.
more-routing supports path (`/foo/bar`) and hash (`#!/foo/bar`) style routes.
-->
<more-routing-config driver="hash"></more-routing-config>

<!--
You can name routes.
It is strongly recommended that you declare all your named routes in an import
such as this, as it acts as a reference for your application, and makes nesting
more clear.
-->
<more-route name="home"  path="/"></more-route>
<more-route name="chat"  path="/chat"></more-route>
<more-route name="reader"  path="/reader"></more-route>
<more-route name="card"  path="/card"></more-route>
